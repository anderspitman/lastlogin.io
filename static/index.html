        <h1 id='intro'>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          LastLogin is a donation-funded login provider. It enables you to log
          in to apps and websites with the convenience of "social login"
          (Google, Facebook, Apple, etc), while greatly improving privacy.
          Instead of choosing from a small set of login providers, with
          LastLogin you can use any email address you want as your identity,
          and even choose from many different email addresses when you log in
          to a site. LastLogin is built on open source software.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to push the web toward decentralized login systems,
          to improve user experience, choice, and security.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>NOTE:</strong> LastLogin is currently in beta. The system
          is ready to handle production load, but has not yet undergone an
          official security review. Until this is done, it is not recommended
          to use LastLogin to sign in to any systems which protect valuable
          or sensitive user data.
        </p>

        <h1 id='demo'>Demo</h1>
        <p>
          The easiest way to see LastLogin in action is to use it to log in
          to the <a href='https://forum.indiebits.io/'>IndieBits forums</a>.
          That is also where support for LastLogin is provided.
        </p>


        <h1 id='faq'>FAQ</h1>

        <h2 id='why'>Why did you make this?</h2>
        <p>
          I wanted my users to have the convenience of social login without
          sacrificing their privacy. Personally I also have been using
          email+password whenever possible and avoiding social login, but I'm
          tired of doing this. The UX is terrible. There weren't any
          alternatives so I made one.
        </p>

        <h2 id='how'>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
          The best way to get a feel is to try the demo. The core user
          experience is very similar to current login providers. An app or
          website will have a "Sign in with LastLogin" button alongside the
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main difference is in how you manage identities. When you click
          to log in with LastLogin, you're taken to a page that lets you add
          email identities from many sources. You can directly add an email
          by entering a code we email you, or you can add an email using one
          of the social providers. Once you've added some email identites,
          whenever you log in to an app or site you can choose which one you
          want to use.
        </p>

        <h2 id='what-is-decentralized-login'>What is a decentralized login system?</h2>
        <p>
          Almost everything you do online is tied to an account or online
          identity. When you use a "Sign in with Google" button or a gmail
          address to create a new account, you're giving incredible power to
          Google to observe and control access to your online life.
        </p>
        <p>
          A decentralized login system puts the control back in your hands. You
          can use any email provider you want, and still get the convenience of
          social login. Ideally you can even use your own domain name and
          switch between email providers easily. This fosters competition and
          leads to much better user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's even possible to run your own email server, which uses
          encryption to guarentee you are the only one with access to your
          email and accounts. This provides ultimate control over your online
          life.
        </p>



        <h2 id='why-another-provider'>How does adding another centralized login
          provider push the web towards decentralized login?</h2>
        <p>
          It's a chicken-egg problem. Apps and websites aren't going to
          implement decentralized login until there are providers that use
          decentralized protocols, and login providers aren't going to
          implement decentralized login until users and developers demand it.
          LastLogin is a stepping stone. A temporary solution. It supports the
          same centralized protocols as other login providers, but it will also
          support decentralized protocols. This will allow app developers to
          integrate with LastLogin using those protocols, and easily integrate
          with other decentralized providers in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Step one is that LastLogin supports email addresses from any
          email provider, and let's you choose which email identity to use
          when you log in. No social login provider gives this level of
          control.
        </p>

        <h2 id='privacy-focused'>How is LastLogin privacy-focused?</h2>
        <p>
          When you use a social login provider such as Google, that provider
          knows and keeps a record of every app and website you sign in to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally social login providers are advertising companies. This is
          no accident. There is a strong advertising incentive for them to
          know as much about you as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          LastLogin improves privacy in several ways. First, we don't collect
          or store any private data. Also, our incentives are much more
          aligned. Since we don't sell ads, we have far less incentive to track
          our users.
        </p>

        <h2 id='security'>How does LastLogin improve security?</h2>
        <p>
          Since we only handle the minimal login information (email address),
          the consequences of any security breach in either an app you use
          or in our systems directly is greatly reduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contrast this with a company like Google that provides many APIs and
          services using the same system they use for login. This makes
          things like phishing attacks much more dangerous.
        </p>

        <h2 id='why-upstream-social'>Why does LastLogin let me add identities with social
          providers? Can't the app or website just use those directly?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, however going through LastLogin provides some benefits. First
          of all, it's much easier for developers. Instead of having to
          register their app with each social provider, jumping through many
          hoops along the way, they only need to support LastLogin, while still
          giving their users the convenience of social login.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, there's a privacy benefit here. Say you want to use
          your Facebook account to log in to an app that supports LastLogin.
          If you use the LastLogin option to add your Facebook identity,
          Facebook has no idea what app you're actually logging in to. Note
          that this isn't as helpful with Google. Although they won't know
          directly when you're logging in, if the app sends any emails to
          your gmail account they'll be able to infer what apps you're using.
        </p>

        <h2 id='passkeys'>Aren't we all switching to passkeys anyway?</h2>
        <p>
          Passkeys are awesome, and we will most likely add support for them in
          LastLogin itself in the future. The main problem is that there's
          currently no way to say "give X access on Y server to the owner of Z
          passkey", unless Z passkey has already been used to log in to Y
          server. This is a critical feature for the decentralized web. If I'm
          running a photo server and want to give you access, I need a way to
          do that. This is simple with email. I can just tell my server to
          share an album with your email address, then as long as you can prove
          you own that email address you can get at the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to this, it remains to be seen to what extent companies
          other than Google, Apple, and Microsoft are able to provide high
          quality passkey experiences to their users. It also remains to be
          seen to what extent passkeys will be implemented on apps an websites.
          Passkeys are complicated to get right. Much more complicated than
          login buttons like LastLogin. We are also skeptical that sites will
          give up the direct access to users that an email address provides.
          Their incentives are not aligned to do so.
        </p>

        <h1 id='donate'>Donate</h1>
